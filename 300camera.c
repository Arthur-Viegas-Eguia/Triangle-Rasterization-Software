viewing volume. For perspective projection, fovy is the full (not half) 
vertical angle of the field of vision, in radians. focal > 0 is the distance 
from the camera to the 'focal' plane (where 'focus' is used in the sense of 
attention, not optics). ratio expresses the far and near clipping planes 
relative to focal: far = -focal * ratio and near = -focal / ratio. Reasonable 
values are fovy = M_PI / 6.0, focal = 10.0, and ratio = 10.0, so that 
far = -100.0 and near = -1.0. For orthographic projection, the projection 
parameters are set to produce the orthographic projection that, at the focal 
plane, is most similar to the perspective projection just described. You must 
re-invoke this function after each time you resize the viewport. */
